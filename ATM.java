#7) Verify each number button on the Keypad.

#8) Verify the functionality of the Cancel button on the Keypad.


 
#9) Verify the text color of the keypad buttons. The numbers should be visible clearly.

#10) Verify the text color and font of the data on the screen. The user should be able to read it clearly.

#11) Verify the language selection option. If the messages or data are displayed in the selected language.

#12) Insert the card, the correct pin, and print the receipt for available balance.

#13) Verify the receipt printing functionality after a valid transaction. Whether the printed data is correct or not.

#14) Verify how much time the system takes to log out.

#15) Verify the timeout session functionality.

#16) Verify the deposit slot functionality depending on its capability (Cash or cheque or both) by inserting a valid cheque.

#17) Verify using different cards (Cards of different banks).

Verifying the Message
#18) Insert the card and an incorrect PIN to verify the message.

Conclusion
ATM machines must be tested for accuracy, reliability, and performance. It should get tested for its response time per transaction as it works for 24*7.

All the above-mentioned points should be considered while testing ATM machines. There should be a combination of both positive and negative test cases while writing test cases for any product.
